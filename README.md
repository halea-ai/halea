# Halea – The Guardian for Modern Applications
[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--release-yellow)]()

> _Halea — from the Old English word for “guardian” or “hero.” Our mission is to guard your app’s user experience._

⭐ We're building Halea in the open. **Star this repo** to follow along and get notified when we launch.

## 📖 Getting Started

⚠️ This repository is currently a placeholder for Halea’s upcoming open-source release.  

---

## 🌍 Our Vision

Halea is building the **quality assurance toolkit for the developers of tomorrow.**  
As AI increasingly writes code, assembles features, and guides the development process, speed will no longer be the challenge - quality will.  
Our vision is to ensure that as development accelerates, **reliability, stability, and user trust don’t get left behind**.

We see Halea becoming the **go-to platform for application quality**, providing not only early detection of issues but also clear solutions and automated fixes where possible.

## 🔍 Current Focus

**Step 1:** Detecting problems in real user flows without writing tests.

- **Why?** Traditional QA requires upfront planning and ongoing maintenance, which slows down teams.  
- **How?** Halea captures and analyzes real user sessions, compares them to expected behavior, and flags deviations - from small UX glitches to critical functionality breaks.  
- **Result:** Teams can spot issues they didn’t anticipate and fix them faster.

## ❗ Why Halea Exists

As development speeds up - especially with AI assistance - the risk of hidden issues grows.  
Traditional testing can't keep pace with constantly changing products, and many bugs are only discovered by users, hurting trust and retention.

**Halea’s mission** is to fill this gap with a new kind of QA toolkit that:

1. Detects and reports anomalies directly from real user behavior - no manual tests required.  
2. Provides clear, actionable insights for developers to fix issues fast.  
3. Integrates into existing workflows to help test, fix, or roll back changes automatically.  
4. Supports both human and AI-led development teams without slowing them down.
